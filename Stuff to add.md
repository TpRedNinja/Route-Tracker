- [x] 1. new sorting options
    *ideas for new sorting options*
    - by type (more for like applying to the sorting options below and the current way of sorting. so instead of by entry id u do by type)
    - remove completed ie hide completed entries but still keep a list of completed in a file
    - put completed entires at the bottom (so instead of finding the first uncompleted entry it finds the last uncompleted and put completed down their still scrolls to first)
    - save last used sorting option
    - add to backup folder like with settings 

---
- [X] 2. Updating the filtering and search bar
    - [x] 2.1 multiple type filtering 
        - *how it will work*
            - each type should be like a checklist item thing
            - ie when u click on it a check mark appears 
            - if all types has a check mark then all the other types also get check marks
            - but if u uncheck one of the types then the all checked gets the checkmark removed but all other types still have their check marks
            - when the route isnt loaded all types option should have a check
    - [x] 2.2 search history dropdown *(remember recent searches)*
        - *how it maybe would work whatever is doable is fine*
            - meant for searching for a entry 
            - basically ig we type something click enter then it gets added to search history 
            - or something like that, although the searching is instant so idk how that would work
---
- [x] 3. logging system
    - app passowrd for google account: cjut ymzr citu xvij
    - Log errors and important events with timestamps (including dates)
    - Save logs locally in a file (append, don‚Äôt overwrite)
    - On application close (with user consent), email log file automatically to developer
    - Use dedicated Gmail account (e.g., TpRouteTrackerApp@gmail.com) for sending emails
    - Authenticate email sending via Gmail SMTP with App Password (16-char, generated)
    - Allow user to add optional details/comment before sending log
    - Detect developer‚Äôs own device (by device name or unique ID) to skip sending emails during debugging
    - Clear log file after successful email sending (optional fallback if user consents)
    - Notify user about privacy, consent, and what data is sent (transparency)
    - Provide manual option to send log anytime from the UI (not just on exit)
    - only create new file if version of application is different and add a -------- seperator if the date isnt the same as last time it was logged
    - easy to refrence for replacing all current error handlers and for in general program use when its running error handling
    - developer email address to send to topredninja@gmail.com or hjdomangue@outlook.com if first email fails
