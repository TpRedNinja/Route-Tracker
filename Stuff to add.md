- [x] 1. import routes from URLs (GitHub raw links, etc.)
    - *description:*
        - option to import route from a url to a raw github link or other platforms with similar raws
    - *how it would work:*
        - in settings panel, a new option to import route from url
        - opens a window with a text box to paste the url
        - tells the user before hand that it must be a raw link ie from github or gist or similar websites with similar types of links
        - has the option to load the route after downloading
        - allows the user to choose the name of the route
        - hotkey topen the window (ctrl + u)(or similar key combo)
        - save downloaded routes to the backup folder like with settings
        - historty of downloaded routes(maybe)

---

- [x] 2. new sorting options
    *ideas for new sorting options*
    - by type (more for like applying to the sorting options below and the current way of sorting. so instead of by entry id u do by type)
    - remove completed ie hide completed entries but still keep a list of completed in a file
    - put completed entires at the bottom (so instead of finding the first uncompleted entry it finds the last uncompleted and put completed down their still scrolls to first)
    - save last used sorting option
    - add to backup folder like with settings

# features to add
## üìù Future Features TODO List

---
## v0.9-beta features list

- [ ] 3. exporting current progress to TSV/CSV for sharing
    - *3.1 through 3.3 below are all prerequisites for 3 (exporting).*
    - [ ] 3.1 multiple type filtering 
        - *how it will work*
            - each type should be like a checklist item thing
            - ie when u click on it a check mark appears 
            - if all types has a check mark then all the other types also get check marks
            - but if u uncheck one of the types then the all checked gets the checkmark removed but all other types still have their check marks
            - when the route isnt loaded all types option should have a check
    - [ ] 3.2 search history dropdown *(remember recent searches)*
        - *how it maybe would work whatever is doable is fine*
            - meant for searching for a entry 
            - basically ig we type something click enter then it gets added to search history 
            - or something like that, although the searching is instant so idk how that would work
    - [ ] 3.3 remove specific types or entries in general (e.g., upgrades, story, chests)
        - *how it will work*
            - basically theirs a button or in the drop down 
            - theirs a option to remove all uncheked types
            - this will exclude the option all types since its tied to everything
            - to specify more, if the user unchecks upgrades and chests 
            - then clicks the button it will remove all upgrades and chests from the route
    - [ ] if all things above are done then move onto the exporting feature
        - *how it will work*
            - in settings panel a new option to export current progress 
                - underneath the import route from url option
                - also have it when right clicking the route grid put it under neath everything else
                - have a seperator line above it
            - opens a window with options to choose between tsv or csv recommend tsv
            - option to choose the location to save the file
            - option to include completed entries or not
            - option to include skipped entries or not
            - option to include only filtered entries or all entries
            - button to start the export
            - shows a window with a progress bar while exporting
            - once done closes the window and shows a message box of download complete
            - hotkey/shortcut to quick open the window fully customizable (default ctrl + e)(or similar key combo)

I want you to add a new feature its called multi type filtering.
I currently have a filtering system that allows me to filter by one type at a time.
I want u to make it so i can filter by multiple types at once.
Currently when i filter by one type it shows the current type in the box
when i have multiply types selected i want u to show instead "Multiple Types".
Currently by default "All Types" is selected when no route is loaded
I want to keep it that way.
Their should be some visual indicator that multiple types are selected in the drop down
it can be a check mark or something else.
If "All Types" is selected then all other types should also be selected.
When no types are selected it should on the display show nothing and in the box say "None".
If the user unselects one of the types when "All Types" is selected
then "All Types" should be unselected but all other types that werent unselected should remain selected.
Ideally u shouldnt need to change much of anything in the current filtering system
But if u do its fine as long as it works and *DOES NOT BREAK ANY OTHER FEATURES*
U should make optimized code that isnt 100's of lines long
it shouldnt give me errors and it shouldnt give me messages saying whatever can be simplified
When generating me the code *GENERATE EVERYTHING I NEED* I WILL NOT STAND FOR TLDR COMMENTS
What i mean by tldr is comments like "// rest of code goes here" or "// current implementation"
I want the full code for everything i need to add this feature DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING or say do it yourself
if you create new files be sure to specify what type of file it is
DO NOT CHANGING ANYTHING THAT DOESNT NEED TO BE CHANGED KEY WORD NEED
