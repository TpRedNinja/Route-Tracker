- [x] 1. import routes from URLs (GitHub raw links, etc.)
    - *description:*
        - option to import route from a url to a raw github link or other platforms with similar raws
    - *how it would work:*
        - in settings panel, a new option to import route from url
        - opens a window with a text box to paste the url
        - tells the user before hand that it must be a raw link ie from github or gist or similar websites with similar types of links
        - has the option to load the route after downloading
        - allows the user to choose the name of the route
        - hotkey topen the window (ctrl + u)(or similar key combo)
        - save downloaded routes to the backup folder like with settings
        - historty of downloaded routes(maybe)

---

- [x] 2. new sorting options
    *ideas for new sorting options*
    - by type (more for like applying to the sorting options below and the current way of sorting. so instead of by entry id u do by type)
    - remove completed ie hide completed entries but still keep a list of completed in a file
    - put completed entires at the bottom (so instead of finding the first uncompleted entry it finds the last uncompleted and put completed down their still scrolls to first)
    - save last used sorting option
    - add to backup folder like with settings 

---
- [ ] 3. exporting current progress to TSV/CSV for sharing
    - *3.1 through 3.3 below are all prerequisites for 3 (exporting).*
    - [x] 3.1 multiple type filtering 
        - *how it will work*
            - each type should be like a checklist item thing
            - ie when u click on it a check mark appears 
            - if all types has a check mark then all the other types also get check marks
            - but if u uncheck one of the types then the all checked gets the checkmark removed but all other types still have their check marks
            - when the route isnt loaded all types option should have a check

    - *3.1 through 3.3 below are all prerequisites for 3 (exporting).*
    - [ ] 3.2 search history dropdown *(remember recent searches)*
        - *how it maybe would work whatever is doable is fine*
            - meant for searching for a entry 
            - basically ig we type something click enter then it gets added to search history 
            - or something like that, although the searching is instant so idk how that would work
    - [ ] 3.3 remove specific types or entries in general (e.g., upgrades, story, chests)
        - *how it will work*
            - basically theirs a button or in the drop down 
            - theirs a option to remove all uncheked types
            - this will exclude the option all types since its tied to everything
            - to specify more, if the user unchecks upgrades and chests 
            - then clicks the button it will remove all upgrades and chests from the route
    - [ ] if all things above are done then move onto the exporting feature
        - *how it will work*
            - in settings panel a new option to export current progress

## what i want
I want you to add a new feature ‚Äî it's called search history.

Basically, I have a search bar, but it doesn‚Äôt remember the last thing that was searched. Since it updates the route grid instantly while typing, there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key to confirm the search ‚Äî which is fine. But I want it to remember what was typed so it works like this:

- When the user types something in the search bar and then clicks away (or does something that disables typing), it should add that typed string to a list of recent searches.
- That list should be saved to a `.json` file called `History.json`.
- The `.json` file should be saved in a new folder **outside** the existing settings folder, but still within the backup directory.
- Call this folder: `Route Tracker json files`.
    - This will be the default folder for saving any new/existing `.json` files that aren‚Äôt `settings.json` and that arent already saved in the backup.
- If the user closes the app and then reopens it, the last searched string should still appear in the search bar via loading the json file.
- When the user clicks on the search bar, it should show a dropdown of previous searches.
- If you have any questions before doing this feature, just ask. Don‚Äôt assume ‚Äî just ask, even if it feels dumb or minor.

## how to generate the code for the feature
When generating the code, make sure to follow these rules:

- Make sure the code is well-commented, based on how existing comments are implemented.
- Generate **all** the code needed for this feature.
- DO NOT put `// rest of code goes here` or anything like that.
- You shouldn‚Äôt need to preserve the existing system if doing so would require a bunch of custom compatibility logic. Just use whatever works.
- Use best practices.
- **DO NOT BREAK ANY EXISTING FEATURES**.
- Avoid errors **unless** it‚Äôs a temporary call to a function that you‚Äôre about to generate in the next step.
- Avoid giving me code that results in IDE warnings like ‚Äúcollection can be simplified‚Äù or similar messages.
- The most important thing: **don‚Äôt break anything**, and please ASK QUESTIONS first.
    - I know I probably didn‚Äôt give enough details.
    - You can‚Äôt assume anything, so ask whatever you need before generating code.
    - For example, if your question is: ‚ÄúWhat new UI element should I use for the search history dropdown?‚Äù ‚Äî just go with whatever you think will work unless I say otherwise.
